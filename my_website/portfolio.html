	 <p> The lightbot program is like a computer because it has inputs that allow you to use the device. The lightbot can jump if you you the spring input or will go forward if you you use the forward arrow input. Light is not like a computer because lightbot is just a program you don't have to use do the coding yourself it's already set up for you to mees around with. </p> </body>
